Hi, I'm Lien ðŸ‘‹
I grew up chasing grasshoppers in a small rice-farming village in Vietnam. I spend a lot of time to run and read.

ðŸŽ“ I'm a student in computer scientist at University of Information Technology.
I'm best reached via email. I'm always open to interesting conversations and collaboration.
